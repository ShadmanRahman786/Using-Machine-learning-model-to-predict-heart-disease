## Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection is critical. This project leverages machine learning techniques to **predict the likelihood of heart disease** based on patient health data.  

---

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scaling, and encoding  
- EDA: Visualizations for feature distributions & correlations  
- ML Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix  
- Bar Charts: Feature differentiation and model performance

##Results

Logistic Regression-86.34
Support Vector Machine-83.9
K-Nearest Neighbors-72.2
Decision Tree-100.0
